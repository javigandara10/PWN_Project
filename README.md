# PWN_Project
Code performed for the final degree project in Physics

The large amount of pulsars without TeV detected Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe) has been a subject of interest in recent years. Although some pulsars have possible PWNe candidates at TeV energies, only a small fraction of them have been firmly identified with PWNe, meaning there is still much to be achieved in this field.
Mainly all pulsars have been detected at radio frequencies so this project aims to predict future detections of PWNe at higher energies, more precisely, gamma-rays at > 1 TeV. In order to accomplish it, a computational analysis of pulsars taken from the ATNF (Australia Telescope National Facility) pulsar catalogue 
has been carried out with the first purpose of studying their main properties, such as period, characteristic age or spin-down luminosity, where different samples of pulsars have been drawn. After defining our PWN evolutionary model we were able to predict PWNe features such as energy density, flux or angular size. 
Analysing these properties we have highlighted a list of candidate pulsars for future TeV detections which will be tracked down by the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). Finally we have made a predicted map of PWNe lying in the Milky Way's galactic plane at 1 TeV energies and a halo source study for old PWNe. 

The research part of this project has been performed during a summer fellowship program at the University of Zurich in 2019. 

We have divided our code in three folders, each of them corresponding to each one of the three samples.
